CRP is a homodimer and consists of two domains connected by a short hinge region. The C-terminal α-helical DNA-binding domain carries a characteristic helix-turn-helix motif. It dimerizes in apo-CRP, with the DNA recognition helix F buried within its core |CITS: [19805344]|. The N-terminal dimerization domain mainly consists of β-sheets and carries a hydrophobic pocket for binding of cAMP. A long α-helix, termed the C-helix, forms an intersubunit coiled-coil. This helix plays a central role in the allosteric activation of CRP. Allostery arises as a natural consequence of changes in global low-frequency protein fluctuations on ligand binding, and there are conserved residues crucial for allosteric control |CITS: [24058293]|. After binding of cAMP, the CRP signal is propagated through lengthening and reorientation of the C-helix to the DNA-binding domain, resulting in the liberation of the DNA recognition helix |CITS: [19359484][19805344]|.

Promoters that are activated by cAMP-CRP can be grouped into three classes, termed class I, class II, and class III promoters |CITS: [10550204]|. Class I- and class II-dependent promoters require one cAMP-CRP for activation and have a single DNA-binding site located upstream of the RNAP-binding site, centered near position -93, -83, -72, or -62 of class I promoters |CITS: [2173826][2167178][12023077]| and overlapping the RNAP-binding site of class II promoters |CITS: [10550204]|.

Class II-dependent promoters require AR1 of the upstream subunit and AR2 of the downstream subunit of CRP.

DnaA is a central focus for regulation of this initiation process, maintaining the critical ratio of one initiation of DNA replication per cell division. As a consequence, a number of factors feed into the regulation of both DnaA abundance and activity, yielding an integrated control over this core cellular process.

Although DnaA binds both ATP and ADP with high affinity, only the ATP-bound form is able to initiate replication under normal circumstances, as described above |CITS: [3036372][9125116][2835363]|.

Averaged across the entire cell cycle, some 15-30% of all DnaA is typically in ATP-bound form. This abundance rises across the course of the cell cycle, topping out at about 80% just ahead of DNA division and cell division |CITS: [10581238]|.  The primary limiter of the abundance of DnaA-ATP is the DnaA regulator Hda, acting in concert with the beta clamp of DNA Pol III |CITS: [7721846][9473485][9674428][10581238][16882985]|. Hda acts as a bridge between the beta clamp of the polymerase and DnaA. Two Hda homodimers bind per clamp via the Hda amino-terminus, and then Hda interacts with DnaA via the DnaA amino-terminus. When this complexing occurs, ATP hydrolysis is stimulated, converting DnaA-ATP to DnaA-ADP |CITS: [15150238][15611053][11254969]|. ATP hydrolysis is inhibited when DnaA is bound to a DnaA box, but this inhibition is overcome by Hda-clamp binding and active DNA synthesis |CITS: [15189445][11309120]|. This suggests that either this interaction is tethering DnaA to non-DnaA-box DNA, or that it may let the DNA polymerase complex drag DnaA off of a DnaA box. This conversion of DnaA-ATP to its ADP state is required to prevent  premature or asynchronous initiation of DNA replication |CITS: [15939703][16041320][16321957][12730188][11483528]|.  DnaA-ADP is regenerated to its ATP-bound form via an interaction with phospholipids. Cardiolipin and various unsaturated fatty acids in relatively fluid membranes dissociate ADP from DnaA, leaving DnaA available for binding by new ATP |CITS: [2835364][8227025]|. Phospholipids lacking unsaturated fatty acids only poorly promote the release of ADP |CITS: [2845401]|. DnaA binding to ",

The regeneration of DnaA-ADP to DnaA-ATP is also promoted by two intergenic regions on the chromosome labeled DARS1 and DARS2.

The major proposed DnaA titration site is datA. The datA site contains multiple DnaA boxes, and titrates out DnaA in a box-dependent manner.

                        ". For this reason the length of the CytR DNA-binding site is variable.   Gene induction occurs when the physiological inducer, cytidine, binds to the CytR regulator and when cellular cAMP levels are high.

As nickel levels depend on the Nik uptake system (NikR regulator, NikABCDE transporter) and nickel is highly used during anaerobic growth by the Ni-Fe hydrogenase isozyme, the additional participation of RcnR and RcnA in nickel homeostasis changes the previous understanding of the cell's nickel processing. Iwig and colleagues ",
                        " showed that RcnR is not directly related to other proteins that use nickel, although they showed that RcnA, as the exporter of excess ions, has direct participation. RcnA likely competes with NikR for nickel ions at low concentrations, and in such a way RcnA downregulates ",

                        "RcdA, also known as YbjK, belongs to the TetR family and is involved in the regulation of a number of stress response genes, biofilm formation, and transcription regulator genes ",
                        "  Genomic SELEX analysis showed that RcdA can bind to the upstream regions of 27 genes. Among these predicted targets of RcdA, six genes correspond to transcription regulators (AppY, CsgD, FimB, RcdA, Sxy, and YcgF). This indicates that a large number of genes must be regulated indirectly by these regulators. Another group of target genes includes membrane-associated stress response proteins (CsgB, NanC, OmpA, PgaA, YbjJ, YehA, and YoeA) and stress response cytoplasmic proteins (Asr and YdeI), among others ",
                        "  RcdA exhibits strong cooperative DNA binding and produces aggregates of RcdA-DNA complexes. In a specific way and with high binding affinity, this regulator recognizes and binds to sites that have closely related sequences. Furthermore, a consensus sequence has been proposed for RcdA sites. This consensus sequence shows a core binding site of 9 bp, TTGTgtACA, with inverted repeat symmetry ",
                        " According to the analysis performed by the curator, the consensus sequence has a length of 10 bp (TTGTgtACAa).  The X-ray structure of RcdA was determined at 2.55 A resolution ",
